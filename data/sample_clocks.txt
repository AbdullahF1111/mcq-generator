The invention of the mechanical clock revolutionized timekeeping. Before clocks, people relied on sundials and water clocks. In the 14th century, European inventors created gears and weights to measure time more accurately. This allowed societies to organize work, prayer, and travel more efficiently. Today, atomic clocks are the most precise, used in GPS and scientific research.
